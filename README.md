# addison-generation
New SOO generation tool. Based on MERN to work as  a web app

To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.

Created git commit.

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test

  npm run eject
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!


  npm start

Happy hacking!
